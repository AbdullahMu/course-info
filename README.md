## Code Challenges

  Every Day from 1:00-1:40pm, you will be doing code challenges. These will not only strengthen your underlying python skills, but your logic and are common practice for interviews when you apply for a job. They will get progressively harder throughout the course and be 25 minutes of coding and 15 minutes of review.

## Slack Tips

- <code>&grave;hello&grave;</code>: Backticks (usually shift + Esc) makes text show up in a monospace font. Great for code.
- Code blocks are made with three backticks:
  <pre>
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  The backticks MUST be on a line by themselves!
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  </pre>
- You can specify the language directly after the backticks to have colors show up on github
  <pre>
  &grave;&grave;&grave;python
    colors = ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  </pre>
- These same backtick tricks also work on **GitHub** and **Slack**.
- `@here`: Sends a message to everyone currently online in a Slack room. Please don't do this unless absolutely necessary!
