# Office Hours

The instructors will be around for about half an hour after class ends if you have questions, and can be reached via Slack, although they may not respond immediately.

We will also have an Instructors Associate, (Esraa Madi - Khalid Alrasheed), holding office hours remotely Sunday through Thursday from 15:00 to 17:00.

You can book time with [Esraa](https://esraamadi.youcanbook.me) or [Khalid](https://khalidalrasheed.youcanbook.me)

Please note that bookings are in 15 minute increments, and come with specific questions for IA's.
